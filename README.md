# RMTDSK
Remote Desktop Controller  

## Using it
First, my english is bad af.  

1. Start RMTDSK Viewer, put the prefered port (localhost and ':' sign must not change, it will explode. KABOOM) and then click on the Connect button. This will start the server, so Client can connect to it.  
2. In another computer (the one you want to control) start RMTDSK Client with parameters. "`--ServerIP-localhost`" and "`--ServerPort-15243`" (by default).  
3. Enjoy!. RMTDSK Viewer will start to show the another's computer desktop, and u can do a click double click by putting the cursor in the Picture area.  

The Taskbar button will force to show the taskbar. Amazing for auto-hide tasbar mode.  

## Yeah.
